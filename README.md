# Data Processing in Python (JEM207)
The course site for the Data Processing in Python from [IES](http://ies.fsv.cuni.cz/). See information on [SIS](https://is.cuni.cz/studium/predmety/index.php?do=predmet&kod=JEM207). The course is taught by [Martin Hronec](mailto:martin.hronec@fsv.cuni.cz) and [Jan Šíla](mailto:jan.sila@fsv.cuni.cz). 


## INFO

### Update 29.3. 
Due date for HW 4 was (as can be seen in the Datacamp) 24.3. I (Martin) made a mistake when updating the course shedule here on GitHub and set it wrongly to 31.3. For those of you who have not completed it yet, due date is set to 31.3. and was already updated in Datacamp. Sorry for confusion.

### Update 17.3.
Recording of the 4th lecture was uploaded into SIS.
We are aware that we lack interactivity, so if you would like to have an individual consultation, please send us e-mail and we can arrange it using screen-sharing.

### Update 11.3. 
Lecture March 10 was last-minute cancelled as part of the steps taken to slow down spread of the COVID-19 virus.
We've also updated the schedule below.
The format of lectures during the next weeks will be specified before the next lecture (17/3).
Deadlines for DataCamp stay the same. 

Stay safe!

# Course requirements
The requirements for passing the course are DataCamp assignments (5pts), the midterm (25pts), work in-progress-presentation (5pts), and the final project - including the final delivery presentation (65pts).
At least 50% from the DataCamp assignments and work-in-progress presentation is required for passing the course.

## Final project (65%)
* Students in teams by 2
* The task is to download any data from API or directly from the web. These data should be processed and visualized in the Jupyter Notebook, with auxiliary scripts consisting of functions and classes definitions as .py files. The project should be submitted as a GitHub repository.
* The selection of the data is up to the students. (Conditional on our approval.)
* Git collaboration as a proof of collaboration of both students.
* More details during the lecture.

See example projects from the previous semesters [here](https://github.com/vitekzkytek/Example_Project) or [here](https://github.com/martinhronec/IES_Data-Project) from last year.

## Project work - presentation (5%)
* Presentation of work-in-progress related to the final project (during the lectures "Project work 1 or 2" on 21/4 or 12/5)

## Midterm exam (25%)
7th of April. Live coding (80 minutes), "open browser", no collaboration between the students. More details during the lecture week before

 # Prerequisities
 Econometrics II. (JEB110) is an explicit prerequisite for bachelor students.

 The course is designed for students that have at least some basic coding experience. It does not need to be very advanced, but they should be aware of concepts such as ` for ` loop ,`if` and `else`,`variable` or `function`.

 No knowledge of Python is required for entering the course.

 # Credits
 Passing the course is rewarded with 5 ECTS credits.
